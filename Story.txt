Whynot Game story


Entering the game

the player sie Mintetest Game like area. After second look he notes the farming mod the tenplus1 version is used. And he hear sounds from ambience mod, the sky is under_sky and maybe lightning or weather(_pack) appears.
The world seems to be bare. In fact they are no other mapgen mods as from minetest_game, and some not intrusive mese_crystals ores, meseor, pbj_pup, tac_nayn.
Mapgen mods tends to take over the game so I am critical before applying mods changing the mapgen behaviour. I like the bare Minetest Game world that keeps all gameplay ways open to the player.
But the player can more then the MTG player because of mods like cozy, playeranim  show_wielded_item or sprint. He see the hunger from hbhunger in hudbars.

Still missed chellenges
The game still lack for challenges. The curent state is a sandbox game even in survival. I search for the next mods that matches the "whynot"-criteria.

1: mobs. All mobs mods/frameworks I seen takes over the world and game. I search for mobs mod that allow "mob-free regions". That means, they should be a way to get areas mob-free without removal of default:dirt_with_gras or any other spawning nodes.

2: rare spawning extras: Pyramids, temples, buildings and other that spawns rare in the world at mapgen, like the installed meseor mod does.
