Minetest game in minetest mods collection style

This minetest subgame show up the diversity of minetest community. The game does not follow any theme and does not try to clone any other blocky game, just minetest as known in community.

The name describes the way the mods are applied to the game. The game does not have rules for mods to be applied all mods welcome. There are some rules why a mod cannot applied to the game

## Whynot Rules for mods

### 1 no take over the game
unfortunately a lot of great mods assumes the player like to play with this mod only. This subgame stands for diversity. That means if a player do not like a included mod, he can play the game without using them (few exceptions)

### 2 no take over the server
Think ahead the point 1 the mod should not strain the server if the mod is not in use. That means no unnecessary ABM's and so on

### 3 no destroy the world
The mod should not be able to destroy players work

### 4 no bad code quality
I look into lua of each mod before decision. I am tolerant against not perfect code, but roughly negligent bad code will be rejected. Advantage for the mod developer: Code review for free ;-)

### 5 no all-in-one mods and lot of unused dependencies
It is difficult to consider an all-in-one mod for described rules. Therefore Maybe an all-in-one mod will be rejected

### 6 most items obtainable in survival
The game should be playable in survival. Therefore the items should be obtainable

### 7 No cheating mods
The mods should not be feels like cheats. The tools should be wared, the walking the world searching for rare items should not be obsolete by item generators.

### 8 Mod under version control
This game is not a new home for mods. Each mod remains and have own upstream. access by version control required for scripted updates. If bugs found in mods in game, please report them to the upstream

## How to include a new mod to this game
Just open a new issue in github-repository https://github.com/bell07/minetest-game-whynot. Mod will be reviewed and included or a discussion started if a whynot rule appears.
