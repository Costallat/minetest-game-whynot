# minetest-game-whynot
Game for Minetest in mods collection style

This game show up the diversity of minetest community. The game does not follow any theme and does not try to clone any other blocky game, just minetest as known in community.

The name describes the way the mods are applied to the game. The game does not have rules for mods to be applied, all mods are welcome. But there are some rules why a mod cannot be applied to the game.

### License statement
Each mods does have own free license.

## Whynot Rules for mods

### 1 no take over the game
unfortunately a lot of great mods assumes the player like to play with this mod only. This game stands for diversity. That means if a player do not like an included mod, he can play the game without using them (few exceptions)

### 2 no take over the server
Think ahead the point 1 the mod should be not strain the server if the mod is not in use. That means no unnecessary ABM's and so on

### 3 no destroy the world
The mod should not be able to destroy players work

### 4 no bad code quality
I look into lua code of each mod before decision. I am tolerant against not perfect code, but roughly negligent bad code will be rejected. Advantage for the mod developer: Code review for free ;-) And if I like the mod, maybe I contribute some optimization lines to get the mod ready for the game

### 5 no all-in-one mods and lot of unused dependencies
It is difficult to consider an all-in-one mod for described rules. Therefore maybe an all-in-one mod will be rejected

### 6 most items obtainable in survival
The game should be playable in survival. Therefore the items should be obtainable

### 7 No cheating mods
The mods should not be feels like cheats. The tools should be weared, the walking the world and searching for rare items should not be obsolete by item generators.

### 8 Mod under version control
This game is not a new home for mods. Each mod remains and have own upstream. access by version control required for scripted updates to the game. If bugs found in mods in game, please report them to the upstream

## How to include a new mod to this game
Just open a new issue in github-repository https://github.com/bell07/minetest-game-whynot. Mod will be reviewed and included or a discussion started if a whynot rule appears
